## Nov 19

* Started up the repository for the task
* Got Unity 2020.2b9 and VSCode
* Decided to go with Stardew Valley. Current plan:
  * Three levels/scenes - farm, house, shop
  * Farming. Plant a crop, water it every day, harvest after a few days getting the grown crop
  * In-game clock, limiting the day. Day cycle
  * Shop to sell crops and buy seeds (make like two or three different seeds to fiddle with different stages/values)
  * If time permits: Add a couple of NPCs to befriend. Fishing Minigame.
* Got my Android phone set for development (sadly, don't have an iOS device, so will only test the Editor script for that)

## Nov 21

* Continue setting up:
  * Get 2D RP asset for Graphics
  * Make a generic 'map square' prefab and fill out the map (8x8 map, still need to bound player character somehow)
  * Add a player character sprite
  * Set up UI canvas and camera to fit
  * Try setting up touch controls with a couple different methods from the google before deciding to just use New Input System
* Waste time getting hassled by 1293851 I encountered on Thursday. Finally get it workarounded after getting interrupted multiple times while window switching
* Spend about 30 minutes trying to import and examine New Input Systems' "Touch Samples" package "thanks" to it being a complete project and also requiring multiple package dependencies (Cinemachine, Probuilder)
