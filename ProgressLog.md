## Nov 19

* Started up the repository for the task
* Got Unity 2020.2b9 and VSCode
* Decided to go with Stardew Valley. Current plan:
  * Three levels/scenes - farm, house, shop
  * Farming. Plant a crop, water it every day, harvest after a few days getting the grown crop
  * In-game clock, limiting the day. Day cycle
  * Shop to sell crops and buy seeds (make like two or three different seeds to fiddle with different stages/values)
  * If time permits: Add a couple of NPCs to befriend. Fishing Minigame.
* Got my Android phone set for development (sadly, don't have an iOS device, so will only test the Editor script for that)
