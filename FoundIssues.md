* One-time issues
  * On first load while creating a new project, I got a dialogue asking to either Load Default Layout or to Reset them completely. Neither option worked though, returning the same dialogue. After closing and reopening the project, Unity opened up as expected without this dialogue.


* Reproducible bugs
  * Two editor windows load when launching project every time - one proper, and one broken rendering only white/black space or corrupted view of proper window - https://i.imgur.com/SNbmLKd.png . Closing either window closes Unity fully. Tried looking for a duplicate in Issue Tracker, but didn't find any, so reported a bug ( 1293851 ).
